# CR6Community-TouchScreen-Firmware Development and Maintenance
# - Introduction and Overview

## Introduction
This series of documents is an attempt to capture and preserve a set of instructions sufficient to lower the technological barrier for interested users of the CR6Community firmware to maintain and extend the touchscreen UI.

### Scope
If we tried to squeeze everything into the one document, it would be too big a labour to read.
We choose instead to produce a series of small reference documents, each limited in scope to one particular subject.

The scope of this document is limited to an introduction to the series and an overview of its contents.

### Other documents in this series
Released:
TBA

In WIP:
* Recommended Tools and Resources
* About Fonts
* TouchScreen/Motherboard Interface Control
* Organization and Workflow Recommendations
* How to Build and Draft a New Release
* UI Translation/Localization
* DWIN display Configuration Guidelines


Planned:
* TBA

The touch screen configuration file "T5LCFG_272480.CFG" has its specification describer in [T5L_DGUSII Application Development Guide20200902.pdf](./doc/vendor/T5L_DGUSII%20Application%20Development%20Guide20200902.pdf) chapter 4. You can use an editor like HxD to explore and edit it (with caution!). The DWIN editor also has a way to edit this file. Many parameters can also be set at runtime.

Font's are currently configured like below:

![Font Settings](doc/font-settings.png)

In the same folder where you have the DWIN tool unpacked a `0_DWIN_ASC.HZK` file is placed. You need to copy that to the DWIN_SET folder, and can flash it directly.
The kerning of the current font is not ideal (especially using numbers that are small, like "1"), so perhaps we should look for a replacement.

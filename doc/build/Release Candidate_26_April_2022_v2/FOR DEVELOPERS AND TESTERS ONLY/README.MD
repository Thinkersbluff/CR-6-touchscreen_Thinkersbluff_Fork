## Instructions for Calibrating the DWIN Display Hardware

**CAUTION - DWIN display calibration is definitely NOT NECESSARY TO INSTALL OR RUN THIS FIRMWARE and NOT for the faint-hearted. DWIN warn that you can brick your display, if you don't do this correctly.  These instructions are included FOR TESTERS ONLY**

DWIN display calibration is normally done at the factory & should not need to be done again by the user.

If, however, you wish to re-calibrate your display hardware (e.g. to enable changing the DGUS2 OS from v3.5 to v4.5 or higher OR to revert from v4.5 back to v3.5), you do this at your own risk. 

The process for converting and calibrating your DWIN display from DGUS2 v3.5 to 4.5 or from 4.5 to 3.5 is now documented in this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/0xwFGiyg4Z8
